**Why does this site exist?**

To promote the [Collective Code Construction Contract](/C4/). To research its use in practice, not limited to Open Source/Free Software projects, but as part of an exploration to transpose the principles of C4 to other fields of community-led behaviours and actions.

C4 is the **result** of years of experience on how Open Source/Free Software communities work but also fail. It has **learned** from these experiences and draws some surprising conclusions on how to facilitate a goal-oriented, focused and inspiring way of working together.

This is desperately needed in these confusing, hype-driven times with lots of **FUD** (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Is there a bettwer way to Get Stuff Done?

**Reverse engineer C4**

So we will go through the **Lessons Learned** that led to C4. Take it apart, explain, understand, discuss and apply those lessons back to our world &mdash; so we can get things done on many levels in better ways.
