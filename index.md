Welcome to **C4process**. A website dedicated to promote and discuss the [Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/42/).

## Why does this site exist?

To promote the [Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](/C4/). To research its use in practice, not limited to Open Source/Free Software projects, but as part of an exploration to transpose the principles of C4 to other fields of community-led behaviours and actions.

### C4

The [Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](/c4/) is an evolution of the github.com Fork + Pull Model, aimed at providing an optimal collaboration model for free software projects. This site explores its feasability also beyond that.

This site is by people for people. To share, learn and implement solutions. It has no trackers, no cookies, no ads. It's a project that focuses on solutions, not problems.

### Who builds this site?

Right now (2023-03-28) it's just me, [Jan Wildeboer](https://jan.wildeboer.net). I am an Open Source/Free Software veteran with a clear focus on positive progress in the communities that surropubnd me &mdash; be it virtual or real. My main interests are in finding pragmatic, easy to implement ways of creating communities that help to change a lot of small thing for the better. My daytme job is [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) EMEA Evamngelist. I am a long time member of the [United Transnational Republics](https://www.utnr.org) and work since many years on fully decentralised Identioty Ownership, which I think is needed to establish a global democracy. My superpower is patience combined with listening and learning.

I am looking forward to have this website being run by a community of people from all over many places and me reducing myself to keeping it working and causing change. I am not relevant. Ideas are bigger than people and ego.
